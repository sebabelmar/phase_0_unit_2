# U2.W4: Accountability Group Creator!


# I worked on this challenge [with: Kevin Kang].

# make a method that takes array of names 
# this method will output list of Accountability groups 
# for three different units 
# should get everyone into an Accountability group of 4 

# things to consider
# Are there built-in methods to do this in Ruby?
# Will you try to avoid putting the same people together more than once?
# If I run this program three times in a row, will the program give me three different outputs? Is that good or bad?
# Should it remember past outputs or not? 


# 2. Pseudocode

# define unit_picker that takes array as a parameter 
# create an empty hash called result
# randomize an array
# While loop and use a times loop inside to pop elements into a hash until array 
#       size equals zero
# outputs a hash, result
#   {
#     group_1 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_2 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_3 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_4 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_5 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_6 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
# }
#
# define phase_picker that takes an array and number of units(n) as parameters
# run unit_picker n number of times and create a final hash 
# return hash, final
# # result = {
#   unit_1_groups =>{
#     group_1 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_2 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_3 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_4 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_5 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_6 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#
#   unit_2_groups =>{
#     group_1 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_2 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_3 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_4 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_5 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#     group_6 => ['kevin,asf,asdf,asdf]
#  }

# 1. DRIVER TESTS GO BELOW THIS LINE

puts unit_picker(fence_lizards).keys.size == 6 # we have 6 groups in each unit
puts unit_picker(fence_lizards).values.flatten.size == fence_lizards.size # we have 24 people total in each unit
puts unit_picker(fence_lizards).values.flatten.sort == fence_lizards.sort # we are not reapiting people inside groups in each unit 
puts unit_picker(fence_lizards).values.uniq.size == 6 # there are no gruops that are equal to each other
puts phase_picker(fence_lizards,100).keys[-1] == "unit_100_groups" #when you pass in n number of units returns the correct key "unit_n_groups"
puts phase_picker(fence_lizards).keys.size == 3 #not passing in number of units should equal to 3 units 
puts phase_picker(fence_lizards)["unit_1_groups"]["group_1"] != phase_picker(fence_lizards)["unit_2_groups"]["group_1"] #elements in unit 1 group 1 should be differnt from elements in unit 2 group 1
puts phase_picker(fence_lizards)["unit_2_groups"]["group_1"] != phase_picker(fence_lizards)["unit_3_groups"]["group_1"] #elements in unit 2 group 1 should be differnt from elements in unit 3 group 1


# 5. Reflection 
# I learned at least 3 really useful thing pairing with Kevin, frist the benefits of defining a Hash as new.Hash{}
# the second one was that when poping elements out of an array and then pushing them into a hash they donâ€™t
# go in as an array.
# An other thing that I learned here was increasing the values of a hush by using +=, that was unexpected.
# This challenge could take me hours but because pairing it took us almost an hour. Which I think is a lot anyways.
# But we where stuck on something and we didn't give up. We gave us 5 minutes experimenting breaks and finally
# the solution emerged.
# Writing the tests was really useful because we had to made scheme of our outcome and that lead us on the entire 
# development of this program.
