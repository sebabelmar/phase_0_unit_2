# U2.W4: Cipher Challenge


# I worked on this challenge with Eiko Seino.



# 1. Solution
# Write your comments on what each thing is doing. 
# If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.

# def north_korean_cipher(coded_message) # Define a method called north_korean_cipher which accepts one parameter
#   # Downcase coded_sentence and turn it into an array of each character
#   input = coded_message.downcase.split("") # Check out this method in IRB to see how it works! Also refer to the ruby docs.
#   decoded_sentence = [] # Initiate an empty array which will hold the decoded sentence.
#   cipher = {"e" => "a",   # This is technically a shift of four letters...Can you think of a way to automate this? Is a hash
#             "f" => "b",   # the best data structure for this problem? What are the pros and cons of hashes?
#             "g" => "c",   # Hash of its keys being the code and values being the decoded alphabet
#             "h" => "d", 
#             "i" => "e", 
#             "j" => "f",
#             "k" => "g",
