Week 2: Flow Control, Recursion, Regular Expressions
-------------------------

### By the end of week 2, you should be able to:
- [ ] Solve a problem using both iteration and tail recursion
- [ ] Apply regular expression methods 
- [ ] Automate repetitive tasks using loops 
- [ ] Use if/else statements, regular expressions, string methods, while/until loops, Enumerable#each methods with confidence
- [ ] Implement a basic Ruby class and identify when to use instance variables

### Assignments and Challenges:

1. **NEW:** [Read up](https://gist.github.com/dbc-challenges/5aea3150ddec2aec1007) on the best way to write test code.
2. **NEW:** Create test code that translates the rspec tests included in the exercise.  See the first challenge for more details.
3. Formulate pseudocode before solving each problem (include it as a comment).  Make sure you pass all the tests and get green!
4. Refactor each solution so the names are clear and the code is concise and D.R.Y. (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself). Ensure your code still passes the RSpec tests by resubmitting it with your changes.  
5. Reflect on your process and understanding (see section below). Include your reflection as comments in your solution.
