# U2.W5: 


## Learning Objectives
- objective 1
- objective 2
- objective 3

## Background


## Directions
 
1. Run the Rspec tests, and then translate at least 3 of the tests into [Driver Test Code](../references/driver_code.md) and include it in the driver code section. If the tests are failing to catch a problem, try writing your own driver test code for it. 
2. [Pseudocode](../references/pseudocode.md)
3. [Initial Solution](../references/initial_solution.md)
4. [Refactored Solution](../references/refactoring.md)
5. [Reflect](../references/reflection_guidelines.md)
6. Sync your changes (push your solution) to Github
7. [Review](../references/review.md)
