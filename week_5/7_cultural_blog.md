## Directions

First, create a new HTML file for your this post in your [USERNAME].github.io website. Create a new HTML file and use the date to name it `week5_cultural_blog.html`. Copy the Code from your `blog_template`. 

Conduct some research on strategies for dealing with conflict. You can include some conflict resolution, but also focus on learning how to identify the source of the conflict. 

Once you've opened your file, write a response to each exercise using the HTML you've learned to set up the file: 

1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? 
2. How did you handle that conflict? What did you do?
3. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
4. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
